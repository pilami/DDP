INSTALLATION

If you have downloaded the jmlr bundle using the TeX Directory
Structure (TDS), that is you have downloaded the archive
jmlr.tds.zip containing doc, tex and source directories, you need to
follow the "Installing from TDS" instructions below.

If you have downloaded the following files:

jmlr.dtx
jmlr.ins

You need to follow the "Installing from DTX and INS" instructions
below.

For further information on installing LaTeX packages see:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=installthings

INSTALLING FROM TDS
===================

Files in tex and doc directories should go in the corresponding
TEXMF directories (for example, /usr/share/texmf-local/ or
C:\localtexmf\).

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*

Example (on UNIX like systems):

unzip jmlr.tds.zip -d ~/texmf/
texhash ~/texmf/

Move the makejmlrbook Perl script from scripts/jmlr/ to somewhere
on your path. If you are using Windows, you will also need to
move makejmlrbook.bat to the same location.

INSTALLING FROM DTX AND INS
===========================

Run LaTeX on jmlr.ins to generate jmlr.cls and jmlrbook.cls:

latex jmlr.ins

To create the documentation (jmlr.pdf):

pdflatex jmlr.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist jmlr.idx
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o jmlr.gls jmlr.glo
pdflatex jmlr.dtx
pdflatex jmlr.dtx

If TEXMF denotes the base directory of your local TeX installation (e.g.
/usr/share/texmf-local/ or C:\localtexmf\) then create the following
directories (if they don't already exist):

TEXMF/doc/latex/jmlr
TEXMF/tex/latex/jmlr

Move the documentation to TEXMF/doc/latex/jmlr/

Move jmlr.cls and jmlrbook.cls to TEXMF/tex/latex/jmlr/

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*

Move the makejmlrbook Perl script to somewhere on your path. If
you are using Windows, you will also need to move makejmlrbook.bat
to the same location.
