LaTeX Class : jmlr bundle v1.13

Last Modified : 2012-02-25

Author        : Nicola L. C. Talbot

This bundle provides:

   * jmlr class
   * jmlrbook class
   * makejmlrbook Perl script

The jmlr class is a LaTeX2e class for articles for the Journal of
Machine Learning Research (JMLR) or for the JMLR Workshop and
Conference Proceedings (JMLR W&CP). It is designed as a replacement
for both jmlr2e.sty and jmlrwcp2e.sty.

The jmlrbook class is a LaTeX2e class that can be used to combine
articles written using the jmlr class into a book. The jmlrbook
class uses the combine class and the hyperref package to produce
either a colour hyperlinked book for on-line viewing or a greyscale
nonhyperlinked book for printing.

The makejmlrbook Perl script can be used to create the hyperlinked and
nonhyperlinked PDFs of a document using the jmlrbook class. It can also
create a set of HTML files that list the included papers with links
to their abstracts and the individual articles as PDFs.
